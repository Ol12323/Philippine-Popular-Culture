            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The SUPERTITOUS mean is a style of thinking or acting that is founded on a fear of the unknown and confidence in magic or luck: a belief that particular occurrences or objects will bring good or bad luck. [count] It is a common superstition that a black cat crossing your path will bring you bad luck. The majority of early Filipinos held different gods, creatures, and spirits in high regard. Through a variety of rituals, sacrifices, and customs, they placate them. They are told by the elders to do what they are told, to respect and revere our forefathers, who are the sources of all superstitions that are still practiced today.
