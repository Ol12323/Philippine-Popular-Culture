              <h5 class="card-title">Siargao</h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">Siargao made its first claim to fame as the Philippines’ surfing capital, and recently as the “Best Island in the World” (awarded by Condé Nast readers for 2018).
                This paradise has been on my favorites list ever since my first trip to the island a decade ago. What impressed me the most were the enchanting lagoons of Sohoton Cove, a natural wonder that’s well worth the 2-hour detour from the Cloud 9 surfing beach. The main island is filled with pristine natural spots as well, including white sand beaches, stunning islets, vast coconut forests, cool tidal pools & more. If you want to enjoy a laidback island lifestyle, Siargao is one of the best places that tourists can go to. You’ll find a mix of “foreign” and “local” here. It is remote yet accessible, and not too crowded despite the coming of new developments in recent years.

              <h5 class="card-title">El Nido</h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">You came to the country to see spectacular beaches and island views. El Nido in Palawan province will not disappoint. In terms of spectacular “over-the-water” sea views, El Nido is my favorite in the Philippines. Imagine hidden lagoons, uninhabited white sand beaches, and massive forest-covered limestone mountains rising out of pristine tropical waters. The “SEAnery” here rivals popular destinations in Asia like Phi Phi/Krabi Islands (Thailand) and Ha Long Bay (Vietnam). The experience of spending a whole day out on the islands is nothing short of incredible. The area of Bacuit Bay is spread over a large area, so spend at least two full days for the island hopping tours (Tour A & Tour C are the best).

              <h5 class="card-title">Coron</h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">In contrast to El Nido’s amazing “over water” views, go to Coron for spectacular underwater views. Here, you can see colorful coral gardens, pristine waters, lots of marine life, and even sunken WWII Japanese shipwrecks. Don’t get me wrong, Coron can hold its own when it comes to scenic views over the water as well. This paradise is home to hidden emerald/blue lagoons surrounded by limestone cliffs. There’s no shortage of incredibly beautiful fine white sand beaches in Coron either.

              <h5 class="card-title">Cebu</h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">Cebu is the country’s #1 most visited tourist destination, and for good reason. It is unrivaled in offering the widest range of things to do and attractions. Cebu is like the “Jack of all trades” among tourist spots in the Philippines.
                You can enjoy scenic natural sites (waterfalls, beaches, mountain views etc.), have exciting wildlife encounters, join a colonial heritage tour, shop at some of the World’s largest malls, or indulge yourself in local food including the prized Cebu Lechon! You can do all of these easily while staying at a luxury resort in Mactan Island, centrally located hotel/airbnb in the city, or a peaceful beachfront resort in the countryside. Your choice!
                If that’s not enough, you can easily hop to nearby islands like Bohol, Negros (Dumaguete) or other major cities. Take full advantage of Cebu’s strategic location in Central Philippines and well-connected flight/ferry network.

              <h5 class="card-title">Boracay Island & Aklan
            </h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">Boracay is a vacationer’s paradise. Taking center stage is 4-kilometer White Beach, prized for its incredibly inviting blue waters, fine white sand, and perfect sunsets. This island is the place to go if you want to take it easy and you’re looking forward to enjoying a tropical resort experience. As you can expect, Boracay caters to a more upscale crowd, but don’t fret, there are many budget-friendly options available. Boracay is small but packs a lot of attractions. Here you can find excellent dining, a wide variety of places to stay, souvenir shopping, and lots of fun water activities, and some nightlife all in one sandy stretch.
                Boracay’s White Beach is a class of its own when it comes to how fine and white the sand is. From my extensive travels in the country, there’s only one lengthy beach that has sand whiter and finer than White Beach. You can find it in the group of islands featured next on this list.

              <h5 class="card-title">Batanes Islands

            </h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">Batanes is the northernmost province of the Philippines. These remote islands are shaped by volcanic forces and strong typhoons. The natural landscape of Batanes is distinct from other parts of the Philippines. Here, you’ll find vibrant green rolling hills, grazing cows, steep seaside cliffs, sparkling clear blue waters, traditional stone houses, and iconic lighthouses. Travelers often describe its Batanes’ beauty as wild, overwhelming, and incredibly scenic. Looking at pictures and vlogs, I can see why it’s a popular choice among adventure seekers.

            </h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 30px;">Banaue is home to the famous Banaue Rice Terraces, another must-see attraction in the Cordillera region. Hand-carved by the Ifugao people some 2,000 years ago, these extraordinary rice paddies are terraced like staircases for giants and follows the contours of entire mountainsides. Banaue is also the gateway to the Ifugao Rice Terraces, included in UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites. Have a memorable local experience by spending the night at a homestay in one of the small villages like Batad or Banga-an. Get immersed in the culture of the Ifugao people, wake-up to a view of the rice terraces with a hot cup of local coffee, and go on the breathtaking hike to Tappiya Waterfalls.
